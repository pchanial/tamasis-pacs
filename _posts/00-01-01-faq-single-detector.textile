title: How to create a map from a single detector?
category: faq
---

A @PacsObservation@ gathers information about the instrument settings, which are stored in the @instrument@ attribute. With the exception of the detector channel, the parameters in the @instrument@ attribute can be modified after instantiation. More information can be found on "what contains a PacsObservation":{{ site.baseurl }}/2000/faq-what-is-a-pacsobservation/.

The field @detector.removed@ controls the list of detectors to be included in the timelines and the field @detector.masked@, the list of detectors to be masked in the timelines. The former is used to distribute the work among processors in an MPI job and the latter to flag the bad detectors. Both control which detectors will contribute to the map.

To speed up the processing and the memory consumption, let's remove detectors instead of masking them. The number of non-removed detectors can be obtained dynamically through the method @get_ndetectors@.

{% highlight python %}
>>> obs = PacsObservation('myobs.fits')
>>> obs.get_ndetectors()
2048
>>> obs.get_tod().shape
(2048, 360)
{% endhighlight %}

The following snippet removes all detectors but one:

{% highlight python %}
>>> obs.instrument.detector.removed = True
>>> obs.instrument.detector.removed[7,12] = False
>>> obs.get_ndetectors()
1
>>> obs.get_tod().shape
(1, 360)
{% endhighlight %}

To restrict the processing to the bolometer matrix 1:

{% highlight python %}
>>> d = obs.instrument.detector
>>> d.removed = d.matrix != 1
>>> obs.get_ndetectors()
256
{% endhighlight %}

Once the @removed@ or @masked@ fields are set, you can "create a map":http:// as usual.
