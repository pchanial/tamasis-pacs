title: Map-maker for Herschel/PACS
excerpt: This package provides tools to create maps from Herschel/PACS observations. It is massively parallel (MPI + OpenMP) and is written in Fortran (for the number crunching) and Python (for the abstraction easiness). Because of its high level of modularity, support for other astronomical instruments might be added in the future.
