Requirements:
=============
o 64 bit computer
o cfitsio >= 3.23 (shared library required, 'make shared')
o FFTW3 3.2.2
o Fortran 2003 compiler
    - gfortran 4.5
    - or ifort 11.1
o python 2.6
    - kapteyn 2.0.2 (http://www.astro.rug.nl/software/kapteyn/index.html)
    - matplotlib 0.99
    - mpi4py
    - numpy 1.4.1
    - PyFFTW3 0.2 with patches (https://launchpad.net/pyfftw)
    - pyfits 2.3 (http://www.stsci.edu/resources/software_hardware/pyfits)
    - scipy
    - numexpr
o wcslib 4.4.4


Recommended packages:
=====================
o ipython
o pyds9


Installation:
=============
To install and test, type in this directory:
./waf configure build install test

By default, the tamasis package will be installed in /usr/local, which requires
admin privilege. To install it elsewhere:
./waf configure --prefix=~/local build install test


Troubleshooting:
================
- on MacOSX, if some symbols are not found, make sure that your libraries 
are dynamically accessible, for instance by setting the environment variable 
DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH.

- if Python 3 is your default python interpreter (in Archlinux, for instance) 
and assuming that the Python 2 interpreter is 'python2', you can run the fol-
lowing command in bash:
PYTHON=python2 python2 waf configure --prefix=~/local build install test
