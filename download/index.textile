The current stable version of the Tamasis/PACS package is 3.2.
The project is hosted at "github":https://github.com/pchanial/tamasis-map/ and there are two ways to obtain it.
  
* Either by retrieving an archive
    - as a "tar file":https://github.com/pchanial/tamasis-map/tarball/v3.2/
    - or a "zip file":https://github.com/pchanial/tamasis-map/zipball/v3.2/.
<br/>
* Alternatively, by cloning the project, using the version control system "Git":http://git-scm.com/:

bc. $ git clone git://github.com/pchanial/tamasis-map.git

The second method is more convenient to make updates (if you've just cloned the repository, you will obviously not get anything new)

bc. $ cd tamasis-map.git
$ git pull
Already up-to-date.

This method is also required if you are to test tamasis' development branch.


Once the package has been retrieved, you may proceed to the "installation":/tamasis-map/installation.
