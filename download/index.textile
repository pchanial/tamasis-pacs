<div class="content">
  There are two ways to download the Tamasis/PACS package.
  
* Either by retrieving a tar or a zip archive at "github":https://github.com/pchanial/tamasis-map/

* or by cloning the project, using the version control system "Git":http://git-scm.com/:

bc. $ git clone git://github.com/pchanial/tamasis-map.git

The second method is more convenient to make updates (if you've just cloned the repository, you will obviously not get anything new)

bc. $ cd tamasis-map.git
$ git pull
Already up-to-date.

This method is also required if you are to test tamasis' development branch.


Once the package has been retrieved, you may proceed to the "installation":/installation.
